[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/https://aws.amazon.com/) is dedicated to support their community of developers. [Blox](https://blox.github.io/) is a collection of open source projects for container management and orchestration on Amazon ECS. Amazon called on the L+R team to design and develop the brand for Blox and craft the custom GitHub page. The project highlighted important lessons in advocacy: understanding who your customers are and what they want through two-way collaboration.
