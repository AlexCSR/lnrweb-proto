L+R works with the Newell Brands Innovation team on mobile innovation projects with the company’s renowned consumer brands. Earlier this year, Newell’s Yankee Candle, an American manufacturer and retailer of scented candles looked to L+R for their expertise on new product development with the Yankee Candle Video Labels Android app. The project highlighted important insights in building a seamless digital customer experience with personalization and digital media.

Customers who visit a Yankee Candle store select a fragrance and one of their photos to be printed on the label.  They then upload a 30 second video and the recipient can scan the label with the Video Label mobile app to view their special message.
