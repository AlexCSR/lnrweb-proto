We are pleased to announce that [Bond Black](https://www.bondblack.com/), an app and concierge service that [Bond](http://www.bond.co/) partnered on with L+R, has been named one of the [top 50 apps of 2016](http://blog.proto.io/top-50-mobile-apps-2016/) by Proto.io.

In today’s fast-paced world, communication often feels fleeting. That’s why receiving a handwritten note feels all the more special. Bond Black is an invite-only mobile and concierge service that lets busy professionals send handwritten notes on customizable stationery from their phone. The experiential service leverages the technology of Bond’s hand-writing robot and senders can digitize their own handwriting for an added personal touch.

“Praise hands emoji times infinity,” prototyping platform Proto.io wrote of the app. It filed Bond Black under the Organization and Productivity category, alongside other well-known apps including EasilyDo and Pocket. The app has also earned coverage in major media outlets including the New York Times and Town and Country.

> “What started as one small project has grown into a strategic partnership for one main reason: We love working with L+R. The team is constantly coming to us with intriguing and ambitious ideas, which is very refreshing. We are especially happy with the great success of Bond Black. In the first six months, we’ve already seen 500% growth. Acknowledgement from Proto.io as one of the top 50 apps of 2016 is very flattering, but perhaps more importantly, our customers love it, and it’s their thoughts that count in the end.”
