**GDUSA starts each year by choosing a group of People To Watch who embody the spirit of the creative community.**

This includes all individuals they have come to know and respect for a combination of talent, leadership, success, newsworthiness and community service. In a field so deep in talent and broad in numbers, this is clearly a subjective process. Still, for five decades, it has seemed to work out pretty well: the roster of past participants is star-studded, to say the least. The 2018 group adds to the luster.

*SENIOR DESIGNER, L+R, BROOKLYN NY*\
Chris has been the force behind L+R’s designs for the past two years. After focusing on packaging and brand design in Los Angeles, he made the move to join L+R’s team in Brooklyn where he has translated his understanding of the analog to the digital product world. Chris believes his background in print brings a more expressive vantage point to the digital branding he executes. He is the first to recognize his deficit in the attention department, and he believes his shifting attention is what gives him to opportunity to constantly try new things. On a never ending path to having “no style,” even as a kid he knew it was time to change things up whenever anyone was able to define him or his work. This is the mindset he brings L+R’s team, helping clients like Amazon, Disney, Google, GE, and Global Citizen stand out, and merging his favorite designer Saul Bass’ motto “I want to make beautiful things” with functionality and the needs of the audience.

Getting outdoors. In the past it’s been hiking/ bouldering, nature has always helped center me. Being in New York has been a challenge in that area. But second to that is good food with good friends, which New York is perfect for.

Architect

A MANTRA OR SAYING YOU LIVE BY?\
Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power
