As a media powerhouse with 200+ million monthly page views, BuzzFeed is constantly exploring meaningful ways to connect with their audiences that also generate alternative revenue streams (like kitchen appliances!?). Bond.co formed an innovative partnership with the BuzzFeed team and L+R was brought on to craft the experience. Leveraging data tracking & analysis, each party involved was able to optimize and validate the activationâ€¦and show some love to Dad.

Check out some of the cards:
