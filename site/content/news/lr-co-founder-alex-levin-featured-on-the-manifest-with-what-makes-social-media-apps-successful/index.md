In their recent article, [The Manifest](https://themanifest.com/) asked [L+R](https://www.facebook.com/levinriegner/?fref=mentions) Co-founder and Director of Strategy, [Alex Levin](https://www.facebook.com/alex.marshall.levin?fref=mentions), what his reactions were to usage statics between the engagement in *Social Media Apps* by individual age groups. L+R’s creative drive for deeper knowledge of human computer interaction lends itself to our work with specialized social network product development for organizations as Global Citizen, Jammcard, and Footlocker. This feature shares insights to our ongoing passion to learn and grow.

Levin mentioned the “90-9-1 Rule” that is an interpretation of the trends of internet creation and consumption.

Over half of social media apps users (56%) open a social media app more than 10 times a day. Most of us with a Facebook or Twitter profile already know the addicting nature of a news feed.

Social media apps are popular and successful – but what makes them that way?\
The Manifest, a B2B news and how-to site, conducted a survey of 511 smartphone owners who use at least 3 different apps daily to better understand people’s opinions and habits when it comes to social media apps.

Levin provided expert analysis on the data, illuminating why age groups react differently to certain social media apps.

The survey found that millennials check Snapchat much more than either Gen Xers or baby boomers.
