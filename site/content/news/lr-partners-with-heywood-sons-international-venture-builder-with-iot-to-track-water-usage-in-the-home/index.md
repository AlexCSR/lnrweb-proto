L+R partnered with Heywood & Sons on their **Watersen** project to design and build the software interface that connects and operates their hardware device. Watersen is a non-intrusive IoT sensor for families to track their household water consumption. The project is co-funded with the Suez Group.

*Estimates vary, but each person uses about 80-100 gallons of water per day.*

L+R built the user interface design that connected the smart device with Bluetooth to the Watersen sensor; creating a seamless digital customer experience for ease-of-use and simple setup.

A project like Watersen allows our production team to leverage their strong acumen for accessibility, human computer interaction, and software/hardware integrations all atop the solid process that lets L+R’s team achieve breakthroughs. That said, I am 100% biased…”
