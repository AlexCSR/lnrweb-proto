Finding work as a musician is difficult, whether you’re the star of the show or a backing band member. There is no easy way to make a living in the music industry, and up until just recently, the only way for those with musical talents to find their next gig was via their personal networks or word of mouth. Sure, those are methods still useful, and many artists definitely continue to reach out to friends when searching for the next paycheck, but in today’s technologically superior world, there must be a better way for the community to stay in touch and for musicians to work together more efficiently.

Musical startup [Jammcard](http://jammcard.com/) launched [a few years ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/07/16/a-stream-of-bills-startups-making-money-for-musics-middle-class/#391012641eac) as something of a music-specific alternative to Craigslist, hoping to become the go-to place online for all musicians to communicate and find work. Since then, the company has shifted gears slightly, and the revamped version (made available quietly earlier in 2017) looks and feels noticeably different. The new Jammcard is streamlined, focused and it works more like a musicians-only LinkedIn, complete with “cards” that work like mobile-first resumes for those whose experience is best understood through YouTube videos and recordings, as opposed to more traditional descriptions of job titles and responsibilities.

While it is billed as a musicians-first outlet, the platform isn’t limited to those who make a living playing an instrument. The site features options to search for producers, music directors, composers, songwriters, engineers, tour managers, production managers, stage managers, lighting directors, video directors and plenty of other industry professionals. When looking for something specific, Jammcard allows members to narrow down the list of potential candidates by genre, gender and even by what gear they use, which is important many artists.

Founder and CEO Elmo Lovano is insistent that part of what separates Jammcard from other similar companies looking to solve the same issue in the music industry is the fact that his creation is not open to the public, and every musician on the site is vetted. “We’re focused on quality of member, not quantity, Lovano explained to me recently, adding, “To me, there’s a big difference in treating someone as a “member” vs. a “user,” and between a private network vs. a public network.”

Currently, Jammcard features musicians who have played with superstars like Bruno Mars, Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, The Chainsmokers and dozens of others. These artists are at the top of their game and the best of the best, but that doesn’t mean some of them don’t occasionally need some help locating their next trek or studio session.

Version 2.0 of Jammcard is currently only serving those musicians in the Los Angeles area, but the company has plans to grow beyond that market, and there is certainly a need. At the moment, monetization is tough for the startup, as it’s only based in a single city, but with expansion comes more funds (hopefully). With such successful names already attached to the startup, it isn’t difficult to imagine Lovano will be able to secure the resources he needs to eventually offer Jammcard membership to worthy musicians everywhere in the U.S., and then beyond.
