L+R is excited to announce its collaboration with Jammcard LLC, the company behind Jammcard, a private network for music professionals.

Jammcard connects musicians, producers, singers, songwriters, directors, technicians, managers and live/studio engineers, helping them showcase their skills, promote their work, network with other industry professionals and, ultimately, land gigs. The invite-only network is currently open to members of the greater Los Angeles community.

L+R led the strategic development of Jammcard, focusing on creating an intuitive user experience. As with most social networks, Jammcard’s success depends largely upon reaching critical mass, so designing an app interface that was both easy-to-use and sticky was vital.

> “The main challenge in redesigning the Jammcard app was in overhauling the entire brand, user experience, and user interface simultaneously. After the initial launch, we’ve been working strategically to continually improve the application design with incremental features based on user feedback and analytics. The result is a powerful app that meets a big market need.”
