We’re proud to announce we won the Silver W³ award for our work on the F. Schumacher & Co iPhone and iPad app.

The app set a new standard for the industry by leveraging interactive inventory search at Schumacher’s worldwide showrooms and by helping their international sales team incorporate new technologies to improve workflow. The W³ award is a humbling confirmation of L+R and Schumacher’s shared vision of improving experiences with an intelligent mix of observational tactics and expertise.

> “L+R exceeded expectations on every front. They really immersed themselves in how our business works and what our brand represents. They helped us channel our design-driven identity into an amazing app that not only looks beautiful but also functions beautifully”
