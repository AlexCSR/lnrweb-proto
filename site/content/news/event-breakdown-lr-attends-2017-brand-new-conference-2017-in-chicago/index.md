L+R Senior Designer, Chris Martinie attended the 2017 Brand New Conference in Chicago.

Originally from UnderConsideration.com – [Read the Full Post](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/2017_brand_new_conference_photos_tweets_and_videos.php)

Here is this year’s breakdown of the 16 sessions of the 2017 Brand New Conference that took place this past September 14 – 15 in Chicago, IL, and which was awesome. (If you are looking at this in an RSS reader head on over to the real thing, too much heavy formatting). This is a very long post with a photo of each speaker, very brief summaries from me and my partner Bryony, collected tweets from the audience, and a preview of their video/session, so give it a good time to load. A few other things worth bullet-pointing:

* Videos for purchase are [now available](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/video/inventory/).
* A lot more photos from the event have been posted in [this Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/underconsideration/albums/72157685382281412).
* Additional videos from the conference not included in this post: [Day one opening remarks and BNConf identity presentation](https://vimeo.com/234547306) / [Day one closing summary](https://vimeo.com/234547046) / [Day two Brand New summary](https://vimeo.com/234482449) / [Day two closing summary](https://vimeo.com/234917883).
* **Registration is [now open for the 2018 Brand New Conference](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/register-2018/conference/) in New York, NY, on September 13 – 14.**
* Next I will post this year’s identity materials. Just have to photograph them and retouch the photos.

That’s it. Enjoy the post. There is a lot of great content from all the speakers.
