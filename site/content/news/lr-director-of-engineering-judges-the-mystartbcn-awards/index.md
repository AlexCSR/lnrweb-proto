On October 24, the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Barcelona celebrated the 4th edition of the “Faro del Mediterraneo” awards (Lighthouse of the Mediterranean).

As a new initiative this year, the Chamber instituted the MyStartBCN prize, awarded to the best Italian startup. We were honored to participate as judges.

We were impressed by the high level of innovation brought by the finalists. The winner in particular has the potential impact to disrupt medical treatments in many key areas like ophthalmology and oncology.

Winner: [http://www.postbiotica.com/](http://www.postbiotica.com/)
