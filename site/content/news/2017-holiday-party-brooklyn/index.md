The annual 924 Holiday Party celebrates friends, family, partners, clients, and citizens of the Earth, old, new, and of the future.

The perfect blend of celebration, nostalgia, creativity, technology, music, visuals, love, positivity, and safe-for-work dionysian antics.

Scroll to see some shots from the newest DartTime Photo Booth by our friends and creative collaborators at [House of 207](http://houseof207.com/). It is a brand new concept from them and while still in its proof of concept phase, you’ll see the effect is alluring. Contact us if you’re interested in taking this to the next level for one of your projects (it comes with a free invite to the next party)
